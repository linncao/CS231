&gt;I need to print up a pamphlet of facts that can disconnect people from their trust of government.

As a very wise, successful union organizer named Al Evanoff taught me, when I had a similar impulse,

"Paper doesn't organize people. People organize people."

It turned out to be some of the best advice I ever heard. Believe it: NOTHING takes the place of face-to-face organizing. There are no shortcuts. But when long-term, serous organizing works right, each one you reach in turn reaches another, and so on and so on.
Is there any better time to start than now?
its the adrenalin, can you imagine the excitement there, well i cant but looks interesting :)

"Savage" may only imply inferiority from certain frames of reference.  "Savage" is often used as a compliment.  "Violent", "oppressive", and "gender-biased" are equally loaded terms depending on your reference point.
PHP is still huge. It has a lot of flaws, but it's easy to learn, easy to host, and very popular.

I know I'm just responding to myself over and over again, but I keep thinking of new points. The questioning during the Dem bullshit about Wright and other such nonsense has mostly been about "how does this fucking retarded shit hurt obama's electability" once he is the nominee - what are they going to ask him? How does this stuff effect his ability to be president? It clearly doesnt have ANYTHING to do with him being president. So... Where's the question? I think some of us are over-reacting. It's going to be all good.
Shit, I was going to name my kid Memristor, now I guess I need a new name.

Why bother? If you're using WPA, then it doesn't matter if you do MAC filtering or not, it adds nothing. All it does is make it more inconvenient every time you want to add an (authorised) device to the network. Anyone who can crack WPA can get your MAC address, and anyone who can't get your MAC address hasn't got a hope in hell of cracking WPA.
Actually I think the reason asynchronous CPUs aren't as widespread is because they're harder to design.
You can't have it both ways. It's collective sympathy or individual responsibility. Why a simple inference has to be muddled by unrelated qualifiers each and every time?

I once rode in a cab with an Afghani cab driver. He had plenty of things to say about America "bringing democracy" to his country. One quote stood out to me that I will paraphrase to the best of my ability: "Bringing Democracy to Afghani people is like giving ice cream to monkeys. They don't know what to do with it. It's a foreign concept. Democracy is not something you can introduce. It's something that must be nourished for generations before it takes root."

There's not much left of a plane when it slams into a giant building at hundreds of miles per hour, but there are plenty of pictures around that show obvious plane parts.
Yeah, I feel that way myself about these "depressing" stories too. It feels like I can't really do much about it, so why bother talking about it. Or, why bother reading these stories at all...

It's an interesting phenomenon of hopelessness that should get fixed, so we don't go invading more countries leaving tens of thousands of civilians dead. Something needs to be done to fix this.

We have rail between Auckland and Wellington here (500Km-ish). It takes all day to get there so nobody uses it, everybody flies as it's only an hour by plane (security takes ten minutes, you just have to be there half an hour before takeoff) so you can just pop up and back in a day. 

They actually tried to shut the train down a year or two ago, but all the people who never used it started screaming about losing it.

The media is spinning against Ron Paul, as usual. It's not a take over when you've been voted in; it's a take over when you appoint a person who wasn't voted in.

There is no chance at all 9/11 was an inside job.  This administration is not capable of such a clever, thought-out, well disguised plan.  They couldn't even keep a couple of pentagon-planted military analysts secret, or the firing of a few attorneys.

Perhaps you have trouble distinguishing The difference. And perhaps redditors do as well.
Angry much? Why don't you point me to three paleoclimatologists who disagree with the IPCC consensus? How about Dr. Andrew Weaver, lead IPCC author and scientist at the University of Victoria in my home town; he's got a few publications to his name: http://climate.uvic.ca/people/weaver/weaver-publications.html

So you write off all Greens because some support Dr. Pianka (who I had to Google to find, and who has never been mentioned to me by Green candidates, supporters, or any post I've read on the Green Party of Canada blog)? That's handy for you. 

Here's my seat-of-the-pants definition of sustainably: Something that can be done indefinitely, because it contributes to people, planet, or prosperity.
Just imagine for a second that she was the only one to have a camera. Then we wouldn't see this footage, this would never be brought to light and she would be charged with 2 felonies and 2 misdemeanors. No one would be the wiser while she was rotting in jail.

This would most likely be the situation any place other then NYC, where hundreds of people aren't packing cameras and aiming them at the pigs. Most other cities you would be lucky to get 2 people with cameras at a particular incident who would be much easier subdued. Plus the footage doesn't exist if the cameras get smashed or deleted.
Actually the death toll would be closer to one and a half million people.

But on the flip side, if you get passionate people talking about this kinda thing, it's easy to dismiss them as "conspiracy theorists." And this judgement is somewhat justified - since the reasons behind this probably isn't some sinister plan, but just simple social phenomenon.

I think our best bet is for some sociologists and anthropologists to study this, understand it, and then propose ways to change our course in a non-accusatory way.

My understanding is that the Fed prefers any level of inflation to any level of deflation. The actions taken today are in line with creating inflation with the hope of counter-acting the looming deflationary threat.

&gt; Your body produces DMT when you're about to die naturally.

and

&gt; It's produced by your pineal gland as your born, in near-death experiences, sleep, and when you die. It seems to be related to stress. Hence why people that almost die see "white lights" and people that are sleeping think they get abducted by aliens and stuff.

Is an amusing idea and, at this point in time, nothing more. It's not fact, as you made it out to be. The purpose of DMT in our bodies is not yet known.

Ahhh...as a former HP insider, I can say that now that a new engineering marvel has been discovered on the HP tree, the race will be on internally to stifle it or sell it to someone else to make gobs of money off of.

The fact that anything innovative has come out of that hellhole after all the cuts to engineering and research is, quite frankly, amazing.  
Rewards. I carry four cards:

* one that gives 5% cash back on restaurants/movies/bookstores
* one that gives 5% on gas/groceries/drugstore purchases
* one that gives 5% on certain purchases categories that change quarterly
* one that gives 2% on everything (which I use for purchases that don't fall into any of the above categories).

If I found a card that could do all of that, I would gladly consolidate down to one card.

Edit: another reason to have multiple cards is that they all have different features. Some give you better travel/rental car insurance. Some charge smaller fees for foreign transactions. Some are very consumer-friendly when it comes to disputing which comes in handy with online purchases from sketchy sellers.
so he gets downmodded for being correct? 
Not all biofuels are bad.  Corn based ethanol's pretty fucked up, though.  The conversion rate's something crazy like a tank's worth of corn ethanol could feed a family for a year.  So that's pretty evil.

That's an assumption without fact.

I can just as easily assume that only Ron Paul diehard fans bought the book. Of course they would rate it highly. 

Just the same way they gamed online polls.
Some comments... I don't agree with the implied idea behind the article. I'm not even a fan of Ubuntu *at all*.

&gt;Canonical makes no secret of the fact that it is eager to sell Ubuntu support contracts to enterprise users. 24x7 support on Ubuntu Server will cost you $2,750 per year, or $750 for 9x5. That's basically the Red Hat business model (with free binaries thrown in), and is perfectly uncontroversial, though surprisingly expensive.


If it's uncontroversial - which it is - why even mention it constantly throughout the article as some sort of sin? Redhat's business model is IMO one of the best out there, managing to conciliate both the free software community interests and the natural commercial interests of Redhat and their clients.

&gt;Lately however Canonical has introduced a new twist into the Ubuntu business model with the launch of its Landscape systems management and monitoring tool. Basically Landscape is very similar to Red Hat Network. It allows you to track the configurations and status of all your Ubuntu desktops and servers, and to install updates under central control (though with full customization options).

Sounds great. Also sounds like a service, and not software, so I don't know what is surprising or odd about it.

&gt;And the catch is? This is completely proprietary code. It's not GPL'd, you can't see the source, and you can't get it for free. In fact, you can't even have the binary, because Landscape is provided as an online service only. 


Here I'm a bit split: as I said above Canonical hs *every right* to charge for the online service (just like Redhat or SuSE do).  They also have the right to keep the server component of Landscape closed, although in here I do think that it is a bit contradictory with their general position. They could provide perhaps the code, while retaining the service. Not a biggie though.

&gt;Only the Landscape client is free and open source, which it has to be of course because it cohabits physically with the kernel on each of your Ubuntu machines.
